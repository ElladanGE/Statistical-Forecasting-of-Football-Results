# Statistical-Forecasting-of-Football-Results
I have implemented the Dixon and Coles model to predict football results of the 2018/19 Premier League Season in R.

I have predicted the first 19 weeks of the Premier League 2018/19 Season. I have used accuracy and profile log likelhood to assess how well the model performed.

I have included all the data files needed the run this model.
